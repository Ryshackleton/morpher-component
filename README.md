# Morpher 

This is a playground to create a d3 component to "morph" directly between various charts (maps with geographic shapes, cartograms, bubble plots, bar graphs).  This is based on a [basic template project that Idyll provides](https://idyll-lang.org/docs/getting-started).

### Installation

```shell
> git clone ssh://git@stash.ihme.washington.edu:7999/viz/morpher-component.git
> npm i
> npm run build:watch
```
